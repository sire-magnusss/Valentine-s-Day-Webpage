    <!-- Section 1: How It All Started -->
    <section>
        <h2>How It All Started</h2>
        <p>
            We first formally met at my cousin Wame's birthday party. I remember seeing you from a distance and thinking, “Hmmmm, I wonder who she is…” In my tiny little bubble, you looked like the MEANEST person at the table. I wanted to introduce myself, but at the same time, I was afraid you would crush me—so I let time play its game. Eventually, we played cards and that other weird whispering game (I forgot its name). You know, the one where you whisper to someone, and it gets passed along until the message distorts, and whoever gets caught with the wrong info is out? Something like that, I think. Hehe.

            Anyway, when we played cards, you turned out to be the total opposite of what I’d imagined. You seemed sweet, nice, caring, and compassionate. Gosh, why am I MAN BLUSHING while writing this? I'm literally smiling as I type. But yeah, as the day went on, I found myself constantly staring at you—kind of weird, I know. But see, I was the only guy there who was in the same age group as Wame’s friends, so tension was bound to develop. Hehehe, yeah yeah, so I kept stealing glances. Me, a person who never believed in love and all that, felt this as a moment of weakness and decided to disregard it, thinking, “Nah, maybe I just like her because she’s sweet, and besides, she’s Wame’s friend.” So I put my feelings on hold.

            Around 6pm, it was time to go home. We got called to take a group photo, and low-key, I wanted to stand next to you, but we’d hardly exchanged words that day. I didn’t want to come off as a creep or break my “cool guy” persona, so I just let it go—though I was definitely thinking, “Damn, maybe I should.” Anyway, after the group photo, we were all discussing how to get back home. I remember we had ridden a combi from Gamecity (after picking you guys up) to wherever the party was. My aunt asked if I wanted to ride with her, but I said, “Noo, I’m good, I’ll ride the combi with everyone else.” Deep down, I just wanted to see you for a few more minutes, waitse. Yet still, I made zero moves—just sat there, excited to be near you but not initiating anything. Eish!

            Also, I recall my aunt asking you, “How will you go back?” but I didn’t catch your answer because I was in another conversation. So, as we hopped on the combi together, I was excited, thinking maybe you guys were heading back to Wame’s house to spend the night and would leave phakela. KANTE, we actually just dropped you off at Gamecity. Sad times (sad emoji ×2). That was that, I guess.

            After that, we always met under random circumstances at school. I remember one time we crossed paths. My spine went cold, and I nearly stuttered—usually, I stutter when I want to say something really cool, but my brain’s processing is too fast for my lips. I wanted to say, “Hey Seipone, wassup?” in a cool way. But all that came out was, “Hi.” You replied, “Hi, how are you?” and I was like, “Good, good, you?” you said ME TOO!! Then we both just walked away. In my head, I went, “Damn, that’s all I could do?” I felt so disappointed in myself. I could’ve said more.

            Another time after our DDD test, I saw you at the school cabins. I said hi, you said hi back, and I asked how the paper was. You were like, “Yhoooo, it was sooo hard!” Then you asked me how I found it. I lied and said, “Same, same,” even though it was the second-easiest paper I’d ever written. I didn’t want to sound like an arrogant, overconfident goon, so I just went with the flow. But that’s when I realized the feelings I once tried to ignore were starting to light up again. I found myself secretly hoping to see you around school, which was so crazy for someone like me who never invests in these emotions. Eish, mind my poor timeline—I’m not the best at telling stories in order, and I usually don’t talk this long, so bear with me. XD

            Actually, the first time I met you at school, I was busy texting Wame throughout class (since I had no friends, lol). I texted her, “Heela Wame, guess who’s sitting on my front right?” Then I told her it was you, hehe. Wame is so evil, waitse. She started telling me about you, plus the fact that I was sitting behind you, and eventually she must have said I was her cousin or something. You turned around, looked at me, and asked, “Are you Wame’s cousin, Tiiso?” I was like, “Damn, no turning back now.” I replied, “Yes, I am,” but then I added that my name wasn’t actually Tiiso—it’s Magnus. I said it in the most awkward way possible, and you didn’t even laugh. I was like, “Damn, I OVERCOOKED.”

            Maybe that’s why every time I saw you, I pretended I didn’t notice you. I was afraid you’d think I was that weird boy who’s Wame’s cousin. Hehe. So yeah... Then fast-forward a few years later: I got your number because I genuinely wanted you to join us for the hackathon. At that time, I was 50/50 about you. Part of me had a small crush, part of me was like, “Naaah, it’s nothing serious,” and another part said we could be good friends if we bonded. I remember the day I got your number on Insta, we talked about K-dramas—whichever ones we liked and why. It was AMAZINGGGG. That’s when I realized, “Ayy, this girl is a KDRAMA MONSTER,” for real. I always thought I watched a lot of K-dramas, but you outdid me, heh.

            A few days later, we had our first hackathon call. I remember wanting to hear your voice, but you were super shy. Once I noticed you were shy, I immediately felt more comfortable taking the initiative—’cause, ironically, if someone is shyer than me, I somehow feel more confident. Human psychology is weird, no? So I even teased you, like, “Seipone, why aren’t you talking?” just to put you on the spotlight, hehe.

            (I’LL STOP THIS STORY HERE, because I have A LOT more to write, but I’m getting so anxious—I want you to read this so bad, especially because you’re mad at me AGAIN! You love being mad at me, ijoo… heartbroken emoji ×10 Anyway, when I continue this story, I’ll talk about the day we confessed to each other…)

    <!-- Section 3: Our Future -->
    <section>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
            Seipone, when I think about our future, I imagine laughter filling the
            quiet spaces, spontaneous trips we decide on a whim, and shared moments
            that will become stories we’ll reminisce about years from now.
            I can’t wait for us to explore new places, grow through every challenge,
            and create memories that prove each day can be better than the last.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the coming months, I’m excited to see where our passions take us who knows
            what adventures we might find or what little inside jokes we’ll come up with
            along the way. Even the everyday routines, like cooking dinner or watching
            our favorite shows, feel more meaningful when I picture doing them with you hehe and yk how much i HATE cooking now bc of my Family.
            I hope we keep inspiring each other, pushing each other to dream bigger, and
            holding hands when the path gets rough.

        <p>
            Seipone, you’ve shown me that real happiness comes from sharing life’s little
            moments with someone who truly cares. Thank you for being the light I never
            knew I needed. I’m so grateful for every memory we’ve made and every one
            still waiting for us. If there’s one thing I hope you never forget, it’s that
            you have a permanent place in my heart — and no matter where life takes us,
            I’ll always treasure the warmth, laughter, and love you’ve brought into my world.
